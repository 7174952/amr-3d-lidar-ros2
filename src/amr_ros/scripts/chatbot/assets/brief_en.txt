President's Message
On October 1, 2023, Mikuni Corporation celebrated its 100th anniversary.
We would like to express our sincere gratitude to all our business partners, local communities, shareholders, and all other stakeholders for their continued support.
In October 1923, shortly after the Great Kanto Earthquake, our founder, Noriyasu Ikuta, established Mikuni Shoten Partnership in Yushima, Tokyo, with the spirit of reconstructing Japan.
Starting with the import of bicycle parts, the business shifted to the import of engine parts in anticipation of the coming automotive era and eventually expanded into manufacturing along with the wave of domestic engine production.
Changing the products we handle in response to societal and era changes, our core businesses in manufacturing today are automotive parts for four-wheeled and two-wheeled vehicles/leisure vehicles, gas control devices, driving support devices for people with disabilities, and welfare/nursing care equipment for those who need care.
In our trading business, which inherits the business model from our founding, we focus on aerospace parts and lawn management machines while aiming to expand into other fields.
As these businesses grow, our domestic and overseas bases have increased, and we now have 38 bases in 11 countries and regions worldwide.
On the occasion of our 100th anniversary, we have once again looked back on our history and re-examined what we have done and what we will do in the future.
What has remained unchanged from our founding to the present is the belief in "contributing to the creation of a prosperous society," as stated in our corporate philosophy, and this will not change in the future.
At the same time, we have become acutely aware of the importance of brand power.
In the era when we were known as "Mikuni of Carburetors," what we lack today is precisely this brand power. Recognizing this, we are determined to make our brand shine again, and we have thoroughly thought about what Mikuni's brand should be.
In this era of transformation, said to occur once in a hundred years, we are being forced to respond to global-scale issues and adapt to unprecedented changes.
Even in such circumstances, what is the unchanging value of Mikuni?
What is Mikuni's contribution to society?
What is Mikuni's reason for existence?
The answer we have arrived at is our brand message: "Create, Protect, and Pioneer."
Our main product in the past, the carburetor, was a vital component that supported motorization at its core.
We believe that we "created" them with expert craftsmanship, "protected" people with technology for safe combustion, and "pioneered" the motorization of society.
From the era of carburetors to the present day, we have devoted ourselves to manufacturing while evolving technology, and by providing products and services that engage with safety and security with a commitment to quality, we have "protected" people's lives and the environment and "pioneered" new paths while adapting to changes in the times.
We will continue to "Create, Protect, and Pioneer" and contribute to the creation of a prosperous society.
We will position this as the core of the Mikuni brand and use it as the foundation of management to enhance our brand power.
Returning to the spirit of our founding, it states, "Search for promising products with future potential, develop them, and nurture them."
Looking ahead, the key will be to strengthen our competitiveness by utilizing system design concepts and digital technology and to challenge new ways of doing business, new ways of working, and new businesses and markets.
With "Strengthening Competitiveness" and "Challenge to New Things" as the two pillars, we plan to formulate our vision and course for the next 10 years by the end of the fiscal year ending March 2024 and present it to everyone as our growth strategy toward 2033.
We will take the first step into the next 100 years, aiming to be a company that is trusted and entrusted with peace of mind.
